# Flutter Wordle ðŸ’™
##### Flutter Wordle Challenge for Flutter Vikings 2022 ðŸ’™



## 

## Description:

We've all played Wordle, where we had to match new words every day! What about building one using Flutter? 

Let's create a Wordle with Flutter that only contains words related to Flutter! For example, Container, GestureDetector, Bloc, etc. It will be fun to create a game that involves our love for Flutter ðŸ’™. 

This Wordle, however, lets anyone play it as many times as they want! Youâ€™ll be able to play as much as you want! And, who doesnâ€™t love our cute little Dash? Wouldn't it be great if players could earn Dash points with every Wordle they solved?

Canâ€™t wait to see what you create!
