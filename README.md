## Let's play 🚀

We've all played Wordle, a game where we have to match new words every day! But, what about building one using Flutter? 

Let's create a Wordle with Flutter that only contains words related to Flutter! For example, Container, GestureDetector, Bloc, etc. It will be fun to create a game that involves our love for Flutter 💙. 

This Wordle, however, lets anyone play it as many times as they want! You’ll be able to play as much as you want! 

Also, who doesn’t love our cute little Dash? Wouldn't it be great if players could earn Dash points with every Wordle they solved?

Can’t wait to see what you create!
